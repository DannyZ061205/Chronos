## Information We Collect

### Calendar Data
- **What we access:** Event titles, dates, times, descriptions, locations, and attendees from your Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar
- **Why we access it:** To display your upcoming events and allow you to create, modify, or delete events through natural language commands
- **How we use it:** All calendar operations are performed directly between your browser and calendar providers. We do not store your calendar data on any servers.

### Authentication Information
- **What we collect:** OAuth tokens to access your Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook Calendar
- **Why we collect it:** To authenticate your identity and access your calendars on your behalf
- **How we store it:** Tokens are stored securely in your browser's local storage using Chrome's secure storage APIs. They never leave your device.

### Usage Data
- **What we collect:** Natural language commands you enter (e.g., "Lunch with Sara Friday 1pm")
- **Why we collect it:** To parse your commands using OpenAI's GPT-4 API and create calendar events
